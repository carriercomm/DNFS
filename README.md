Distributed Network Filesystem with Load Balancing

A distributed file system allows the user to visualise and access the data in a client-server environment as if the data is present locally. In a multiserver environment, there might be several clients trying to connect to the server. However the servers have a limitation on the number of clients to which it can provide service at a particular instance of time and exceeding this limit may cause the system performance to degrade due to overload. In this project we aim to reduce the load on a particular server by dynamically redirecting the client requests to another server. The approach used to address this problem is discussed in the following sections of the paper. File requested from the overloaded server will be replicated to some other server and the client can obtain a read-only copy of the file from this server. This would distribute the load among servers to stabilize the performance parameters. Efficiency of the policy used to choose servers for replication will determine the efficiency of the load balanced system.
